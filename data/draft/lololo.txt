task later : inspecting (https://neuroscope.io/gpt2-small/11/2372.html)and put replacemnt text like hu 
maybe (https://gradio.app/) if we figuer out

Sure! Here are a few ideas for projects for the hackathon: 
1. Developing an interactive tool to visualize and explain neural network models. 
2. Creating a library of interpretable models that can be used to explain complex decisions made by neural networks. 
3. Developing a framework for automatically generating explanations of neural network predictions. 
4. Building an interactive web-based platform for exploring and understanding the inner workings of deep learning models. 
5. Creating an open source library of interpretable machine learning algorithms that can be used to explain model predictions.

can I use  toknizer for spesfic model by replacing .to_tokens method 
vocab dict can be modfied in gpt-2 model
